# EC203 Seminars (2022-23) Term 2 Overview material

Hi! These are some STATA do-files where I mostly generate data to give an overview of concepts covered in EC203 Problem sets. This is **not** extra study material. This is just to help you understand some basic ideas in plain English. I find that geometrical representation of these are really helpful, so I generate some graphs. I also add some comments to the actual problem set do-files on this.
